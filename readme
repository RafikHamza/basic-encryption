# Learn Encryption Basics

An interactive educational platform for learning about basic encryption algorithms.

## Features

- **Interactive Learning**: Clear explanations of Caesar, XOR, and Vigenère ciphers with visual examples
- **Practice Tool**: Encrypt and decrypt messages using different algorithms
- **Knowledge Quiz**: Test your understanding with interactive quizzes
- **Leaderboard**: Track your progress and compare with other learners
- **User Accounts**: Save your history and quiz results

## Algorithms Covered

1. **Caesar Cipher**: A substitution cipher where each letter is shifted a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
2. **XOR Cipher**: A cipher that applies the XOR logical operation between plaintext bits and key bits.
3. **Vigenère Cipher**: A method of encrypting text using a series of Caesar ciphers with different shift values based on a keyword.
